# Cargo Loop for Dummies  
The simplest, most robust Musiness Banager cargo loop. Ever.  
Idiot-proof, simple as can be, and only 105 or so lines. it makes sure MB is installed, will automatically start MB if it's not started already, will automatically apply settings.
No crash cam, no sky removal, no teleporting, no pad emulating, none of that. Just a simple loop. 
This is no more safe nor dangerous than the other cargo loop luas [already] out there and musinessbanager. **Use at your own risk.**
(This obviously requires musiness banager.)  
  
## Install  
Drag everything except the readme.md and LICENSE file into your Lua Scripts. Done.
